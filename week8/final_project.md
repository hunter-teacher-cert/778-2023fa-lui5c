For our final project, Andy and I decided to turn toward public education, focusing on student performance on the New York State English Language Arts (ELA) exam. NYC Open Data makes student scores on the ELA exams administered from 2006 to 2022 public. We had originally aimed to include the most recent ELA scores, the data for the 2023 ELA exam isnâ€™t public yet, most likely because it is too recent. The historical and legislative context for these scores is full of political back-and-forth: the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 influenced student performance in different ways, establishing spending goals and education goals while also imposing many top-down goals for schools in all 50 states to meet. In addition to the public ELA scores, we also plan to access the public federal budget for education to understand how more financial resources may put schools in a better position to succeed.

NYS collects so much information from the standardized testing of its students, always for the purpose of measuring the learning outcomes of its students and the efficacy of its teachers. While standardized testing data to the public is usually presented on a school- or neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis, we hope to show how the overall trends in achievement across public schools are affected by external factors, namely federal public education policy. With the help of our program (and a user-friendly presentation), policymakers, voters, and most importantly, parents, can stay better informed of broader trends in education that happen over the course of different presidential administrations, state governors, and federal and state education bills and policies.
